The purpose of this project is to learn Apache Kafka (https://kafka.apache.org/).
I'm mainly interested in the Spring Boot integration. Therefore, I picked https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqVfCyfCJqw&t=19s as the main tutorial that I will follow for this demo.

Questions that I have as I'm going into this project:
- How is Kafka different from message queues like RabbitMQ?
- How does Kafka compare to Camunda?
- Is migrating topics/data a problem. Is it harder/easier than Camunda?
- How well is it integrated in cloud infrastructure like AWS and Azure?
- Is it purely backend? Does it integrate with React/Angular or do we still just use REST APIs?
